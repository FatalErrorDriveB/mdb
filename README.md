# mdb
## Master Document Bot for Discord

This is a bot designed for discord servers. It's purpose is to simplify
my writing servers needs, as such it may not make a lot of sense to use in other servers. You are free to do so however.


# Basic Commands:

* ^ - is the command prefix, for now this is not changable outside the code itself.

* mdoc - Creates a master doc channel for a use within the Master Doc category. (Do to me still learning this command 
may not work outside of my sever without changing some of the code)

* help - Shows a full list of commands.

* follow @user - Follows the @mentioned user if they have a follower role set up.

* unfollow @user - Un-follows the @mentioned user if you're following them.

* mf - Shows a list of people following you.

# Writer-RPG commands:

* create - Creates a Writer_RPG profile. (Activating any Writer-RPG command will automatically do this.)

* stats - Shows your current stats

* battle - Starts a battle with an AI
(options: * - Removes chance of weak enemy, 10 - Number of minutes you'd like the battle to take. Whole numbers only.)
